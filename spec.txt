ConvertCoins(String FromCoin, String ToCoin, Int FromAmount, Int ToAmount, Address WalletId, Int WalletCommandId, Hash Signature)
	If 
		* Wallet has has enough fromCoins
		* and signature matches
		* WalletCommandId is the next id for that wallet
		* WalletId is the owner of both Currencies
	Issue two transactions
		WalletId -> FromAmount:FromCoin -> *
		* -> ToAmount:ToCoin -> WalletId


PlaceBid(String FromCoin, String ToCoin, Int FromAmount, Int ToAmount, Address WalletId, Int WalletCommandId, Hash Signature): BidId
	Lots going on here.
	This would place a bid if the usual constraints are met
	A transaction is generated that places the coins in escrow (nothing actually needs to happen for this, but other transactions need to be aware of it)
	If the bid can be matched, then transactions are generated to do the trade

CancelBid(BidId id, Address WalletId, Int WalletCommandId, Hash Signature)

IssueNewCoins(String CoinName, ....)
	Allow cion owners to issue new coins?
	Possibly acting like a stock split, and adjusting exchange prices accordingly

ProposeTrade(From, to, amount, etc)
RespondToTrade(...)
CancelTrade(....)
	Propose a trade with another wallet which can be cancelled, accepted or rejected.
